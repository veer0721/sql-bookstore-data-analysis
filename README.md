# 📚 SQL Bookstore Data Analysis


## 🚀 Project Overview
The project uses a **bookstore dataset** consisting of information about
    1. Books
    2. Customers
    3. Orders.  
After cleaning the data in Excel (removing duplicates, formatting dates, correcting data types, etc.), I imported it into SQL and created three relational tables: **Books**, **Customers**, and **Orders**.
    1. 🧹 **Cleaned and structured data** using **Excel**  
    2. 🗄️ **Created relational tables** and imported data using **MySQL**  
    3. 📊 **Performed analytical queries** to uncover insights and trends  
then I wrote **20 SQL queries** (10 basic + 10 advanced) to analyze trends, customer behavior, and book sales performance.
